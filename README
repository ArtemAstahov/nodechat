If you are following the tutorial on fzysqr.com, make sure to use the v0.1 tag.

Visit http://nodechat.no.de/ for a live demo of the latest version.

Here it the roadmap for the next week or so. Any suggestions or bug fixes are welcome!

**WARNING** - Current unstable branch is actually unstable. It will break auth for old users. Should work fine for new users.

TODO:

 - Total History
 - Persist/restore directs/mashtag subscriptions
 - Implement UX to display historical mashes
 - away messages
 - security issue with dm mash spying
 - hash passwords
 -- Handle old users
 -- Handle hash auth

Horrible bugs:

 - Dashes/@s in middle of words don't show up in chats
 - user names with spaces can't be direct messaged
