*** THIS CODE IS OLD. ANCIENT! DEAD. DECEASED! ***

Node.js is still rapidly evolving. Nodechat was written before some pretty heavy changes to socket.io and I didn't think it was worth it to update it. I revamped the tutorial code to use a simplified version and "retired" this version. 

If you are following the tutorials on fzysqr.com, you may want the tutorial version of nodechat at https://github.com/jslatts/nodechat-tutorial.
